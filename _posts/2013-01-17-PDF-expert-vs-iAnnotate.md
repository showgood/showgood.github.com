This is only the addition to this review:

#annotation view:
##iAnnotate PDF
slightly better because it shows the highlight color.

however it also has an issue when oepnning a pdf with annotation made in PDF expert,
then its annotation view can't not show the text with highlight, just say highlight with empty

#customize toolbar:
iAnnotate PDF turns out useful for the case when you want to highlight with different color, then it's easy to
achieve in iAnnotate PDF since you can put two highlight pen(with different color) in the toolbar

But it's difficult with PDF expert since everytime you have to change the color and feel cumbersome

#Text Stamp:
PDF expert is easier than iAnnotate PDF to create Text Stamp

#Sync folder:
##iAnnotate PDF
For example, if you have a folder call Reading in Dropbox, then in iAnnotate PDF, it will have the directory structure:
Library-->Dropbox->Reading

Also you see some noise which is other folders in dropbox in that case which makes a little messy 

##PDF expert
PDF expert is better since you can map a remote folder without having to follow the directory structure for that remote folder 

#File Info:
PDF expert: can NOT see the info like file size, not convenient sometimes

#Highlight :
iAnnotate PDF sometimes works funnily especially across multi-line
Also have to tap Done after highlighting is a bit annoying 

#Dictionary:
Surprisingly iAnnotate pdf doesn't use iOS built-in dictionary, instead it uses google and Wikipedia which
Requires internet connection. Also the result is not as nice as ios built-in dictionary

#Annotation:
##iAnnotate PDF
Can't find how to create annotation like rectangular or circle with iannotate pdf

Easy with pdf expert

#background Sync:
iAnnotate pdf doesn't support sync when it's switched to background 

Pdf expert can continue sync even after switched to background
